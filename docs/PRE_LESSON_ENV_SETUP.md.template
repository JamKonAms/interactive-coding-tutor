   - Navigate to your project directory
   - The file explorer will show your project structure

2. **Understanding Slash Commands**
   > 💡 Throughout your journey, you can use these helpful commands:
   - Type `/explain` to understand any code or concept
   - Use `/debug` if you encounter any issues
   - Try `/generate` to see more examples

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

### 1. Creating Your {{ terminology.environment }}
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it:
{% if platform == "windows" %}
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
{% else %}
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
{% endif %}
```
> 💡 Highlight the commands above and use `/explain` to understand what they do!

### 2. Installing Your {{ terminology.tools }}
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> 🔧 If you see any errors, highlight them and use `/debug` for help!

### 3. Verifying Your Setup
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Verify pip installation
pip --version
```

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before proceeding to the main lessons, confirm that:
- [ ] Cursor IDE is running

2. The script will guide you through personalizing your learning journey
3. You'll receive a custom lesson plan based on your interests
4. Start with Lesson 0: Terminal Fundamentals

## 🔄 Quick Reference

- **Need to reactivate your environment?**
  ```bash
  {% if platform == "windows" %}
  .\venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
  {% else %}
  source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
  {% endif %}
  ```

- **Installing new packages?**
  ```bash
